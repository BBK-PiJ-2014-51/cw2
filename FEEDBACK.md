"Try and use unit testing where possible.Â 
A good set of tests.
In general, provide javadoc for all methods.
Coding for Fraction is fine.
Tests for Calculator examine evaluate - which is the right approach.
Use Sets where possible for validation of input.
Use constants in preference to literals if at all possible.
Well done."
